Standard Operating Procedures for storing and using Bitcoin.

A repo created in the style of an I.T. helpdesk standard operating procedures guide for resources, guides, and methodology explainations for understanding how to properly use, store, and secure Bitcoin.

Prior to this repo, most Bitcoiners learned proper Bitcoin usage through word of mouth. Getting the right video suggested to them, getting the right social media post, or even just being on the right platform and knowing the right people. In this repo, we combine all these resources into one guide so that the Bitcoin community organizers or family computer wizards can help the people around them with maximum effectiveness.

This repo is written in markdown so that references to other files can be made easily.
