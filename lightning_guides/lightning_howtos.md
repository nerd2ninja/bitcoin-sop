## Backing up Phoenix wallet from force closed channels

https://phoenix.acinq.co/faq#what-happens-if-acinq-disappears

A warning about Pheonix. Everytime you establish a new channel, Pheonix will take a 30% cut (so 3,000 sats for a 10k channel). This is not 30% for every transaction. If you fund 10k sats and spend 5k, you can recieve 5k sats without the 30% channel establishment fee (because you're using the channel you already have). Additionally, each time channels are updated, Phoenix sends an encrypted version of their data to its peer. Put another way, Phoenix replaces your receipt history with their own making punish transactions not really possible, unless you manually back up your LN data.
