## Backing up Phoenix wallet from force closed channels

A warning about Pheonix. First 10k sats has 30% fee. Fees are much lower thereafter. Additionally, each time channels are updated, Phoenix sends an encrypted version of their data to its peer. Put another way, Phoenix replaces your receipt history with their own making punish transactions not really possible, unless you manually back up your LN data.
